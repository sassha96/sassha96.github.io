                    <h4>Being a reader means you’re more likely to learn something new every day.</h4>
                    <br>
                    <p>An education professor, Anne E. Cunningham wrote a research paper and discovered that reading frequently
                        does actually make you smarter. Not only does it help you retain knowledge, but it helps you to remember
                        that knowledge later on in life. Whether or not you realize it, reading stockpiles your brain with
                        new information, and you never know when it may come in handy.</p>

                    <h4>Reading can be therapeutic.</h4>
                    <br>
                    <p>According to Cristel Russell, a behavioral researcher, reading can help with any stress or turmoil occurring
                        in your life. If you’re going through a break-up, or simply just need to relax, try a new book.</p>

                    <h4>People who read are more likely to vote, exercise, and be more cultural.</h4>
                    <br>
                    <p>A study by the National Endowment for the arts concluded that reading makes you more engaged throughout
                        life, taking advantage of any activities that may spring up during your life.</p>

                    <h4>Reading enhances your memory.</h4>
                    <br>
                    <p>Every time you read something new, your brain ‘makes room’ to fit it in. With these new spaces, you can
                        take advantage of any new information that may arise.</p>

                    <h4>Reading helps to boost your analytical thinking.</h4>
                    <br>
                    <p>Reading helps you to recognize various patterns that occur in writing. If you are looking for a law or
                        medicine career, this is important!</p>

                    <h4>People who read are more likely to get ahead when it comes to their careers, and life in general.</h4>
                    <br>
                    <p>Honor Wilson-Fletcher said that reading “opens doors and makes life easier, so at the end of the day
                        it doesn’t matter what you read. What’s more, it really can make you feel good!” This is very true,
                        and it outlines how important it is to read, if you want to live a successful life.</p>

                    <h4>Reading can help prevent Alzheimer’s.</h4>
                    <br>
                    <p>A recent study found that people who read are two and a half times less likely to be diagnosed with Alzheimer’s
                        Syndrome later on in life. Although this does not mean that reading will prevent the disease, it
                        proves a slight relationship between reading and prevention.</p>
